# InternshipSlotChecker
A tool deployed on AWS Lambda to help checking internship slot (HCMUT), Public version

I'm just a noob ðŸ¥¹ so the tool is very ez, everyone can easily build it. ðŸ¥¹

The code is for AWS Lambda development. If you want to use it locally, you must modify the BE (you can try using an AI tool â€” it's simple). The same goes for the FE!
